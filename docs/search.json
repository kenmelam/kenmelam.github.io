For instance, in her album Reputation, pop was the overwhelming primary genre. However, in recent albums such as folklore, evermore and Midnights, there is a resurgence of songs in the american folk, country and ballad genres.\nHowever, which albums did the best in terms of average page views per song?\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems like folklore, a primarily folk-pop album was most popular. Since users mainly use the Genius website to search for lyrics, it can be inferred that the highest number of users wanted to know more about the lyrics of the songs on the album. Let’s look even further into this – what keywords in Taylor’s folklore album came up the most?"

William Bowery is actually Taylor Swift’s ex, Joe Alwyn. He produced many of the tracks on “folklore” with her, under this pseudonym. Perhaps fans are most interested in songs written on “folklore” as they could get a glimpse into Alwyn and Swift’s relationship. To read more about William Bowery and his contributions to Taylor Swift’s songs, click here.\nSince they’re now broken up, Taylor Swift can consider continuing collaborations with Jack Antonoff, who has been working on her recent albums with her. Besides Antonoff, she should also look into collaborating with Joel Little, Ali Payami, Max Martin and Jahaan Sweet again, who have written fewer songs with her but have garnered more interest in the songs that they have contributed to."
