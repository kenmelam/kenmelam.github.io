    "text": "Welcome to Kenme’s project website!\nI am a second-year Communications & New Media student at NUS. I’m interested in fashion, pop culture and the media (of course)! Hence, my project is about Taylor Swift’s music and how it resonates with audiences. This looks at the genres of music she has produced and its correlation with its popularity, as well as the use of certain themes or lyrics.\nThis data set contains information from Genius about Taylor Swift’s discography, including the number of page visits for each song. As the Genius website features the song lyrics of each song and an analysis of their lyrics, it serves as a reflection of the popularity of Taylor Swift’s music as only those truly interested in it would search for this information.\nThis analysis can help to inform Taylor Swift’s executives and producers on how her future music should sound like in order to maximise the number of listens per song and increase overall profits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a listen to some of her music here!"

    "text": "Let’s take a look at how Taylor Swift’s music has changed over time, by looking at the genres of music she’s produced.\n \nFrom the data above, we can see that Taylor Swift moved away from folk and country genres to fully embrace pop as her main genre of music over the years. For instance, in her album Reputation, pop was the overwhelming primary genre. However, in recent albums such as folklore, evermore and Midnights, there is a resurgence of songs in the american folk, country and ballad genres."

Since users mainly use the Genius website to search for lyrics, it can be inferred that the highest number of users wanted to know more about the lyrics of the songs on the album. Let’s look even further into this – what keywords in Taylor’s folklore album came up the most?"

Analysing this will allow Swift to choose the right producers to make music with her in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the album “folklore” was released in 2020, we can look at the producers who worked on bringing this new sound to life. Aside from Swift herself, this would most prominently be Christopher Rowe, Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner and William Bowery."

From this boxplot, we can see that the median song page views were highest for those written by William Bowery.\n \nSo, who is William Bowery?\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprise! William Bowery is actually Taylor Swift’s ex, Joe Alwyn. He produced many of the tracks on “folklore” with her, under this pseudonym.
