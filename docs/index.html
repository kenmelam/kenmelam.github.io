1 He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie" Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin' stuck On backroads at night And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me September saw a month of tears And thankin' God that you weren't here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street And there's a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that you'll read Is, "When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place" When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me Oh, think of me, mmm He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie"

And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile, so he won't see

And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah But that's okay I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission But I'm ready to fly I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world Oh, I'm just a girl Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh Oh, I'm just a girl

Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside Oh, yeah How can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in And I can still see you, this ain't the best view On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside Oh-oh Oh, oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh
