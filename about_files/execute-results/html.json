I'm interested in fashion, pop culture and the media (of course)! Hence, my project is about Taylor Swift's music and how it resonates with audiences. This looks at the genres of music she has produced and its correlation with its popularity, as well as the use of certain themes or lyrics.\n\n```         \n{r}\nmainPanel(\n   img(src='taylor.png', align = \"right\"),\n  )\n```\n",
