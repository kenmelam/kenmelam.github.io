Taylor Swift is undoubtedly a titan of the music industry. Question is, does she know how to retain that title in the long run? To answer this question, this report provides an analysis of Taylor Swift's song popularity over the years, utilizing various data visualization techniques to highlight trends and unique insights. 

## How has Taylor Swift's music genres evolved over time?
Let's take a look at how Taylor Swift's music has changed over time, by looking at the genres of music she's produced. 

```{=html}

```

From the data above, we can see that Taylor Swift moved away from Folk and Country genres to fully embrace Pop as her main genre of music over the years. For instance, in her album "Reputation", Pop was the overwhelming primary genre. However, in recent albums such as "folklore", "evermore" and "Midnights", there is a resurgence of songs in the American Folk, Country and Ballad genres. 

## Heatmap of genres against song page views

However, how does this relate to the average song page views she received?

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)  # for str_detect

taylorswift <- read.csv("taylorswift.csv")  # Adjust path as needed

selected_albums <- c("Taylor Swift", "Fearless (Platinum Edition)", "Fearless (Taylor's Version)", 
                     "Speak Now (Deluxe)", "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)",
                     "Red (Deluxe Version)", "Red (Taylor's Version)",
                     "1989 (Deluxe)", "1989 (Taylor's Version) [Tangerine Edition]",
                     "reputation", "Lover", "folklore (deluxe version)",
                     "evermore (deluxe version)", "Midnights (3am Edition)")

taylorswift <- taylorswift %>%
  filter(album_title %in% selected_albums)

genres <- c('Country', 'Country Rock', 'American Folk', 'Folk', 'Ballad', 'Pop')
cur_col <- taylorswift$song_tags
taylorswift$Country = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[1]]))
taylorswift$Country_Rock = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[2]]))
taylorswift$American_Folk = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[3]]))
taylorswift$Folk = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[4]]))
taylorswift$Ballad = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[5]]))
taylorswift$Pop = as.numeric(str_detect(cur_col, pattern = genres[[6]]))

genre_columns <- c("Country", "Country_Rock", "American_Folk", "Folk", "Ballad", "Pop")
genre_data <- taylorswift %>%
  select(album_title, song_page_views, all_of(genre_columns)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = genre_columns, names_to = "Genre", values_to = "Present") %>%
  filter(Present == 1) %>%
  group_by(album_title, Genre) %>%
  summarize(Average_Views = mean(song_page_views, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Heatmap plot
ggplot(genre_data, aes(x = album_title, y = Genre, fill = Average_Views)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Genre Popularity by Selected Albums", x = "Album", y = "Genre") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  
```
From this analysis, it seems that that recent albums which showcase American Folk and Folk are most popular, which are genres not explored by Swift since her debut self-titled album, "Taylor Swift" in 2006. 

## Which producers made the best music?
So, who is behind this move to produce more songs in these genres? Who on her team knew which direction to go in? Analysing this will allow Swift to choose the right producers to make music with her in the future.

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)  # Saw online that this can help to handle dates so I don't have to do it manually

taylorswift <- read.csv("taylorswift.csv")  # Adjust path as needed

taylorswift <- taylorswift %>%
  mutate(song_producers = strsplit(as.character(song_producers), ",")) %>%
  unnest(song_producers) %>%
  mutate(song_producers = gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", song_producers),  
         song_producers = trimws(song_producers),  
         year = year(ymd(song_release_date)))  # Extract year from the release date using lubridate

top_producers <- taylorswift %>%
  group_by(song_producers) %>%
  summarize(total_songs = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  top_n(10, total_songs) %>%
  pull(song_producers)

filtered_data <- taylorswift %>%
  filter(song_producers %in% top_producers) %>%
  group_by(year, song_producers) %>%
  summarize(songs_per_year = n(), .groups = 'drop')

lineplot <- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = songs_per_year, color = song_producers, group = song_producers)) +
  geom_line() +  
  geom_point() +  
  labs(title = "Appearance of Song Producers Over Time",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of Songs Produced", colour="Producer") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))

# Display the plot
print(lineplot)

```
Since the album "folklore" was released in 2020, we can look at the producers who worked on bringing this new sound to life. Aside from Swift herself, this would most prominently be Christopher Rowe, Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner and William Bowery. 

## Which producers made music that listeners cared most about?
Out of the top producers, which ones made tracks that people were most interested in? From this boxplot, we can see that the median song page views were highest for those written by William Bowery. 

```{=html}
<iframe height="700" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://kenme.shinyapps.io/shinyapp5/"> </iframe>
```

So, who is William Bowery?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
img(src="william.png", height="80%", width="80%", align = "center")
```

Surprise! William Bowery is actually Taylor Swift's ex, Joe Alwyn. He produced many of the tracks on "folklore" with her, under this pseudonym. Perhaps fans are most interested in songs written on "folklore" as they could get a glimpse into Alwyn and Swift's relationship.

Since they're now broken up, Taylor Swift can consider continuing collaborations with Jack Antonoff, who has been working on her recent albums with her. Besides Antonoff, she should also look into collaborating with Joel Little, Ali Payami, Max Martin and Jahaan Sweet again, who have written fewer songs with her but have garnered more interest in the songs that they have contributed to.

## Additional Analysis: Colours of the albums
Since users mainly use the Genius website to search for lyrics, it can be inferred that the highest number of users wanted to know more about the lyrics of the songs on the album. For Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, many fans want to dress up according to the colour scheme of each album. This chart can help fans figure out what colours appeared the most, and plan their outfits accordingly!
