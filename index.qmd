From the data above, we can see that Taylor Swift moved away from folk and country genres to fully embrace pop as her main genre of music over the years. For instance, in her album Reputation, pop was the overwhelming primary genre. However, in recent albums such as folklore, evermore and Midnights, there is a resurgence of songs in the american folk, country and ballad genres.
