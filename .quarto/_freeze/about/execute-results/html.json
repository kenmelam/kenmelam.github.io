I'm interested in fashion, pop culture and the media (of course)! \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<img src=\"kenme.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nHence, my project is about Taylor Swift's music and how it resonates with audiences. This looks at the genres of music she has produced and its correlation with its popularity, as well as the use of certain themes or lyrics.\n\n## The Dataset & Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<img src=\"taylor.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis data set contains information from Genius about Taylor Swift's discography, including the number of page visits for each song. As the [Genius](https://genius.com/) website features the song lyrics of each song and an analysis of their lyrics, it serves as a reflection of the popularity of Taylor Swift's music as only those truly interested in it would search for this information. \n\nThis analysis can help to inform Taylor Swift's executives and producers on how her future music should sound like in order to maximise the number of listens per song and increase overall profits.\n\nHave a listen to some of her music here!\n\n```{=html}\n  <iframe height=\"1000\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://kenme.shinyapps.io/myshinyapp2/\"></iframe>\n```\n",
